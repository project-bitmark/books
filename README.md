It also contains a decentralized identity system, Bitmark Passport and ability finely tune permissions of files and folders.  Bitmark Passport aslo helps to create a global web of trust and reputation system where good actors will be rewarded for good actions.

Bitmark Storage is based on the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid) framework, which culminates in 25 years of research and development from the creators of the world wide web.

Integration with the bitmark currency will also enable those that share content to be compensated for use of their bandwidth and disk space.  The first version of this will be an OTC market, future versions will be automated and integrated into software and grounded in the block chain, as required.
