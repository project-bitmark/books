# Scaleway Installation

Scaleway is an example of a Cloud server well suited to run Bitmark Storage.  Below is a guide to setting up a server on scaleway, and similar steps can be used on other cloud providers.

**Select A Server**

Scaleway offers a number of servers.  At time of writing it is possible to run a server with unmetered bandwidth, 50 GB of storage and running Ubuntu 16.04 for 2.99 EUR per month.  This is the target used in this guide.

**Log in to the machine**

To log into a scaleway server locate the IP addres and ssh to root@ip-address.  This will log you in as root.
